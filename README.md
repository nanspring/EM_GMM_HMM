# EM_GMM_HMM

This is a hand code expectation maximization with Gaussian mixture model and hidden markov chain. The points.dat file is 
assumed to be sequential. 
This code is not optimizied or  vectorized by numpy. All the for loops are to ensure that the algorithm works correctly.


The converge of maximum log likelihood of train and testing data can be seen at the EM_HMM_Graph.png
